## 🤯 Favorite Quotes
> I invented the term Object-Oriented, and I can tell you I did not have C++ in mind.<br>
> <em><strong>~ Alan Kay</strong></em>

> A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing.<br>
> <em><strong>~ Alan Perlis</strong></em>

> The best programs are written so that computing machines can perform them quickly and so that human beings can understand them clearly. A programmer is ideally an essayist who works with traditional aesthetic and literary forms as well as mathematical concepts, to communicate the way that an algorithm works and to convince a reader that the results will be correct.<br>
> <em><strong>~ Donald Knuth</strong></em>
